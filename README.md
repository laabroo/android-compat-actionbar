The `ActionBarCompat` sample from Android 14 (Ice Cream Sandwitch) repackaged as
a library.

The upstream project implements a very limited subset of ActionBar functionality
and this library suffers of the same limitations.

For complex applications [ActionBarSherlock][ABS] is a better alternative since
it strives to implement all of ActionBar functionality and make it available to
all Android platform versions.
